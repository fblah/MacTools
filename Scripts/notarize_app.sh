# Notarizes and staples the packaged "DMonte Tool Box.app" so Gatekeeper opens it
# without warnings on other people's Macs. Run AFTER Scripts/package_app.sh has
# produced a Developer-ID + Hardened-Runtime signed app.
#
# Credentials come from the environment (never hard-coded — this repo is public).
# Provide ONE of:
#
#   A) App Store Connect API key (recommended for CI):
#        NOTARY_KEY_ID, NOTARY_KEY_ISSUER, NOTARY_KEY_PATH (path to AuthKey_*.p8)
#
#   B) Apple ID + app-specific password:
#        NOTARY_APPLE_ID, NOTARY_TEAM_ID, NOTARY_PASSWORD
#
#   C) A pre-saved notarytool keychain profile:
#        NOTARY_PROFILE  (name passed to `xcrun notarytool ... --keychain-profile`)
#
# If none are set, this prints how to configure them and exits 0 WITHOUT failing,
# so `make_release_artifacts.sh` can run unnotarized for local/ad-hoc builds.
# EXCEPTION: in CI with a real Developer ID identity (CODESIGN_IDENTITY set),
# missing notary credentials are a hard error — publishing a Developer-ID-signed
# but un-notarized app would get Gatekeeper-blocked on every downloader's Mac.
